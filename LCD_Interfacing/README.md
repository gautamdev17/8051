# LCD Interfacing with 8051

This project demonstrates how to interface a 16x2 LCD display (LM016L) with the AT89C51 microcontroller using Keil C and Proteus simulation.

## Files:
- `lcd_interface.c`: Program to send data to LCD and display a character.
- `lcd_simulation.pdsprj`: Proteus simulation file showing circuit with AT89C51 and LCD.
- `Screenshot.png`: Output showing the character on LCD.

## Concepts Covered:
- LCD command and data sending routines
- Delay functions in embedded C
- LCD pin connections with Port 2 and control pins on Port 1

âœ… Simulated and verified on Proteus.
