# 8051 Programs
Welcome to my mini-lab of 8051 C programs.  
This repo contains the basic, fundamental programs I’ve been writing as I learn 8051 microcontroller programming. Whether it's blinking an LED or playing with interrupts, this is where it all lives.

## Tools I Used
- Keil µVision
- 8051 (AT89C51)
- Proteus

##  What's Inside?

| File                    | What it does                                         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `LED_blink.c`           | Makes an LED blink                                   |
| `Switch_controlled_LED.c` | Turns LED on/off based on a button press           |
| `LCD_display.c`         | Prints stuff to a 16x2 LCD                           |
| `Timer_mode1_delay.c`   | Delay using timers                                   |
| `Serial_echo.c`         | Receives a char and sends it back                    |
| `Interrupt_toggle.c`    | Toggles an LED on external interrupt                 |

More coming soon as I keep exploring and breaking stuff

##  How to Run?
1. Open any `.c` file in Keil µVision  
2. Set up 8051 target  
3. Build & run  
4. If you’re fancy, simulate in Proteus
